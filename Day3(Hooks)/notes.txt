--> we can not write anything after return
--> we can only return single data/entity/variable/value
--> there must be a single written in a function that must be the last statement

--> fragment tag is used to wrap up the code so that we can return more data

--> but in place of fragment we can use empty tag

and these tag doesn't show in the frontend bcz these are tags of the react


--> Eventlistner = which listen the event that what event is happening
--> Eventhandler = which perform the action after listening the event

--> in jsx everything written in curly braces{} run without permission

--> we use {} to embedded js code
